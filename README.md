# Vanilla JavaScript Form Validation

This project was made to practice creating form validation parameters using vanilla JS. During this project I learned:

...How to use CSS to separate labels and inputs into ide by side columns

...How to use JS to validate text and number entry

...How to use a JS regex to validate email input

...How to use JS to create a DOM response to invalid inputs
